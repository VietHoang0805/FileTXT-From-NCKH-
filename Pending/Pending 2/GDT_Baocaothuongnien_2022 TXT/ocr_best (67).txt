P/E-Price eamings ratio at the end of 2017 was 7.3 times, it means the investors had to pay VND 7.3 per VND 1 of income.

In 2017, P/E ratio was adjusted slightly than 2016, and compared with the average ratio of wood industry of 14.9, it can be seen that GDT is a worthwhile share to invest.

With the main material of rubber wood, the sharp increase in wood prices led to lower ROA and ROE in 2017, a slight decrease of 1-2% com- pared to 2016. However, the price of wood is up to 40%, but that ratio of only 1-2% reduction is a success of the BOE in controlling cost of goods sold and selling price.

1. Revenue Increases in both Domestic and Export Markets:

- Export Markets: Facing the sudden increase in the wood price, the BOE has considered many factors (market prices, customer charac- teristics, etc...). In addition, with the motto of always sharing difficulties with customers, the BOE submitted to the BOD to approve the flexi- ble pricing policy. As a result, the long-time customers have understood the GDT's price policy and brought the orders from China to GDT. The export revenue in 2017 increased by 13% compared with 2016, exceeding the annual average growth rate of 10%.

- Domestic market in 2017 the revenue increased by 7% compared to 2016, but only achieved 89% of the plan due to completion of imported goods, other cheap-price production workshops, market share has divided into small pieces and especially the changes of supermar- ket owners such as Metro, Big C... In this situa- tion, the Domestic Marketing team has not only caught up the growth of Digital Marketing to strongly increase marketing activities in order to raise the brand awareness but also focused on finding new customers. With new 131 points of sale positions, the total number is up to 1,042 ones. In addition, GDT products have been avail- able in 5 new markets including Quang Tri, Lao Cai, Ca Mau, Quang Ninh and Thanh Hoa.
