"ENLIGHTENMENT KEY "

In front of the head office of Duc Thanh Wood Processing Joint Stock Company (GDT), any observing person will recognize behind the bronze bust of Mr. Le Ba- the founder of Tam Hiep Wood processing work- shop in May 1991- the forerunner of today's GDT, there is a big key to be upright. There must be "subliminal message" here.

Anybody also owns the keys (material) and when facing with difficult problems in life, they need to find out the key (spirit) to open. Therefore, the key has both OPENED and CLOSED functions... It is not only an intimate thing in human life, but also a signifi- cant symbol of spirit. Many people believe that the key is a strong message of strength and authority, expressing the importance of someone in a specific context or a limited space. The key indicates exploration of new things and opens up new opportunities in life and be symbol of wisdom, knowledge and decodes every problem.

With this meaning, any Enterprise needs own "an enlightenment key".

To GDT, Mr. Le Ba is as a key. He was a pioneer of using rubber wood (a kind of wood is harvested after completing the latex producing cycle) to process household uten- sils, outlining manufacturing direction and stable business for GDT. He was also the founder of knowledge for many employees to help them get new vision, more respon- sive and creative, so that they have been contributing to build GDT be strong and developed as today.

More importantly, he defined a business philosophy for GDT "Take VIRTUE as a foundation will be SUCCESFULL", it means that doing business is on a "clean and green" basic to bring the highest ben- efits to human and environment.

When putting the key symbol behind Mr. Le Ba's statue, Board of Directors of GDT - the successors - not only express their deep gratitude to him, but also promise that "GDT is continuing to develop based on the VIRTUE foundation". In addition, with the enlightenment key, GDT is totally confident to reach SUCCESS in the future.
