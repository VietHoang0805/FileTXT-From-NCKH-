3.6. Inventories

Inventory measurement

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

The costs of inventories shall comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. The cost of work in progress and finished goods includes materials, direct labour and attributable production overheads based on normal levels of activity.

The costs of purchase of inventories comprise the purchase price, non-reimbursable taxes and duties, and transport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of inventories. Trade discounts and sales rebates on substandard and obsolete goods purchased are deducted from the costs of purchase.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimat- ed costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Inventory cost formulas

Inventories are measured using the weighted average method.

Method of accounting for inventories

Inventories are recorded under the perpetual inventory method.

Provision for decline in value of inventories

The provision is recognised for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory items and an excess of the cost of inventories over their net realisable value in accordance with Circular No. 228/2009/TT-BTC dated 07 December 2009 issued by Ministry of Finance.

The difference between the required balance and the existing balance of the provision for a decline in value of inventories is included in cost of sales in the income statement.

Inventories are written down to net realizable value item by item.

Materials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost.

3.7. Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed asset recognition

Tangible fixed assets are initially recognised at their cost. The cost of purchased tangible fixed assets comprises the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the assets to their present location and working condition for their intended use. Accessories added to fixed assets when purchased are recognised separately at their fair value and deducted from the historical cost of the respective tangible fixed assets.
