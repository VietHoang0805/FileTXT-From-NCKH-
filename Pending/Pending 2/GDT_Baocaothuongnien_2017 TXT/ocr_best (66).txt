under the close direction of the Board of Direc- tors (BOD) in the difficult context of the wood processing industry. 2017 was an incredibly difficult and challenging year because the wood price the main source of raw materials Increased suddenly, the wood price increased up to 40% within one year. This was the year that the rubber wood price had the fastest and high- est increase in the history of the rubber wood market, exceeding VND 7 million/m3, was estab- lished in 2012. The main cause of the sudden price increase is that China closed their natural forest by themselves from the beginning of 2017, many Chinese companies have come to Vietnam, and established a system of buying rubber wood and acacia trees in a large quantity.

In this situation, the leader team of GDT from the BOD to entire of the BOE has tried to find solu- tions and issued the flexible policies at different time to overcome difficulties in this period, made efficient use of the current resources to bring profit after taxes about VND 101 billion. Today, I am in a cheerfulness to report our accomplish- ments and orientation in 2018. In this occasion, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the cooperation, the companionship of all sharehold- ers and employees trusted us and we commit to

Profit after taxes (VND billion)-Profit growth rate ( bring the best income and profit for all of you.
