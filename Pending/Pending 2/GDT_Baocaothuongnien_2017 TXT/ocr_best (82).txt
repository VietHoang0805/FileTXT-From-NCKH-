NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3.18. Taxation

Corporate income tax

Current corporate income tax expense

RSM

Current corporate tax expense is determined on the basis of taxable income and the rate of corpo- rate income tax (CIT) of the current year at 20%.

Deferred corporate income tax expense

Deferred corporate tax expense is determined on the basis of the deductible temporary differences, taxable temporary differences and the estimated CIT rate that will be applied for the years that assets and liabilities will be recovered. The tax rates used will be the tax rates (and tax laws) that are in effect at the financial year end.

Deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences, unless:

The deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss);

All taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and asso- ciates, and interests in joint ventures when the parent, investor or venturer is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, unless:

The deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss).

The deferred tax assets for all deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures are only recognised when it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset shall be reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilised. Any such reduction shall be reverted to the extent it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the year except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different year, directly in equity.
