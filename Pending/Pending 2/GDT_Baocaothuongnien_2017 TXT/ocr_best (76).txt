Report on the financial statements

RSM

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Duc Thanh Wood Processing Joint Stock Company (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") prepared on 30 March 2018 as set out from page 05 to page 34, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017, and the income statement and cash-flow statement for the financial year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements. The accompanying financial statements are not intended to pres- ent the financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than Vietnam.

Management's Responsibility

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards and Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and relevant legislation as to the preparation and presentation of financial statements and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reason- able assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclo- sures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial posi- tion of Duc Thanh Wood Processing Joint Stock Company as at 31 December 2017, and of the results of its financial performance and its cash flows for the financial year then ended in accor- dance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards and Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and relevant legislation as to the preparation and presentation of financial statements.
