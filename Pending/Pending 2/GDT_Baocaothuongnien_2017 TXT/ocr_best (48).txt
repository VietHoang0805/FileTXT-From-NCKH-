CHAIRWOMAN'S MESSAGE

"... The wood price increased, the wood price stopped increasing for a while and then increased again. The wood price increased, the wood was too scarce to buy. Because of this, wood quality was so poor. The wood raw materials price increased appropriately 40% but the selling price could not increase accordingly". Signs of bad news from the early days of 2017 made both the Board of Directors and the Board of Executives as standing in the fire with anxiety what happen would be to the enterprise if there were no materials for production. The meetings, deliberations and resolutions were directed, after that we all had to follow reports and implement disciplines or incentives etc.... and so on. The company's leaders seem older to find solutions to Duc Thanh Wood Processing JSC. (GDT) throughout the whole year... CHAIRWOMAN'S MESSAGE

Dear valued Shareholders,

Now when recalling the difficult journey and looking the round accounting figures, the high dividend rates, I just thought it was as in a dream. We have been disturbed occasionally and raised questions: What would happen if we could not buy wood? What would happen if the input raw materials increased but the selling price could not increase accordingly? What would happen if we did not know how to handle the power of all staffs? And what would happen if there were no "sharp heads", no meditation of the leaders to make timely and appro- priate decisions.

Thinking like that in order to see how heavy our responsibilities are, the 7 members of the Board of Directors, 4 members of the Board of Executives, only those persons had to help GDT to overcome all difficulties to achieve the target successfully...Maybe, it was because we have not allowed ourselves to break GDT's tradition for many decades of "always overcome difficulties, swim upstream to the goal". We also have not allowed ourselves either to lose the trust of share- holders or to make them disappointed.

Total revenue of GDT in 2017 reached more than VND 362 billion, up 12% compared to 2016, exceeding 2% of the plan; profit after taxes was VND 101 billion, up 6% against the previous year, reaching the whole year plan. Sometimes I am a little bit surprised with a revenue of VND 362 billion but profit of VND 101 billion which means that the interest rate is approximately 30%. Wondering whether it's true? This increase was maintained by GDT for many years. What made the marvelous- ness? I remember an article compared GDT to "a money printer sounding like a joke but it's not exaggerated at all.

It can be said that this is a very considerable result and worth to be acknowledged in the context of general difficulties of the wood processing industry. These achievements, once again show that the Board of Directors has always had the strategic vision, always been with the Board of Executives to direct on time and to give right directions. All staffs have been united, creative and worked hard to excel assigned tasks. Besides, we had to mention our partners who have cooperated closely with GDT; the shareholders and customers who have supported GDT for many years.

Last year, it was surprised that GDT was honored for the first time to receive a certificate of Top 3 listed companies having the best investor relations activities in 2017 (IR Awards) voted by financial institutions at the announcement ceremony orga- nized by Vietstock cooperated with Finance and Life News -Fili. This was a great award to affirm GDT's business philosophy "transparency - honesty" of the Board of Directors and the Board of Executives.

To reach the Top 3, besides providing sufficient and timely information in accordance with the regulations, GDT had to meet strict criteria of securities companies and investment funds about friendly website, ensuring interests of the shareholders, organizing annual investor meet- ings, interacting with media channels and so on. GDT is also evaluated as one of the listed compa- nies having outstanding business results, finan- cial transparency, bringing high profit for share- holders, contributing to improve workers life.

In parallel with doing business effectively, GDT is always interested in creating practical values for the community through charity activities such as giving scholarships, notebooks and bicycles for disadvantaged students in Ho Chi Minh City: caring for poor families at Lunar New Year, donat- ing stainless steel bottles for Spratly islands...

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen!

Entering into 2018, the world economy is forecasted to flourish... but in our opinion, it still contains many risks, especially the rubber wood price has not had signs down. Therefore, we must still take precautionary measures and properly preparation accordingly. However, with a good history of operations over the past few decades plus available potentials as men- tioned above, I have a strong belief that if we join hands, we will continue to achieve success.

The Board of Directors promises to be side by side with the Board of Executives in order to direct appropriate business methods, to ensure to bring profit to the Company, to continue to complete tasks assigned by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, to build GDT become one of the leading enterprises of wood process- ing industry in Vietnam.

Finally, we would like to express our deep grati- tude to suppliers, agents, customers, domestic and international strategic partners, staffs, shareholders, etc...who are companying with us for nearly 27 years.

We would like to wish you and your family for good health, happiness and success in life!

On behalf of the BOD
