The statue Of Mr. LE BA

the late chairman with "ENLIGHTENMENT KEY"

The Key

From ENLIGHTENMENT TO SUCCESS

Anyone who comes to Duc Thanh Wood Processing JSC (GDT) will feel a very active source of energy, as well as wonder when seeing the key symbol behind the bronze bust sculptured meticulously. Why there is a key, why the key is attached with the bronze statue. Who is the bronze statue? Why it is not put in another location instead of placing solemnly in a cool yard, close to the entrance to GDT's head office.

As we all know that the key is a daily familiar item to each of us. It is not only used to open and close a lock, but also has other special meanings to GDT. This is "enlightenment to success", no matter how difficult the door is, it can be opened. The key is also a strong symbol, showing experience, overcom- ing many events and challenging stages but still standing firmly year by year.

With GDT, the key leading to success was Mr. Le Ba. Besides founding Tam Hiep Wood Processing Workshop developed to Duc Thanh Wood Pro- cessing JSC as today, he was a pioneer of using rubber wood (a kind of wood is harvested after completing the latex producing cycle) to process household utensils, kitchenware

and wooden toys. He was also the person who enlightened the way of operation; oriented style, knowledge, business culture for GDT's staffs; built a legacy team with vision in order to fulfill the mission to develop GDT sustainably and prosperously.

Up to now, GDT has built an important leadership team together with all staffs implementing Mr. Le Ba's business philosophy as follows:

"Improve management is to improve quality,

Keep the prestige is to keep customers"

Business has to base on "green and clean" and to bring the highest benefits to people, society and living environ- ment. When he was alive, he often said that Duc Thanh was not merely a place to work but it was a place to express dreams, enthusiasm and desire to suc- ceed so that each day was a new beginning.

With great affection for the founder - He was like a father of all employees in the company when placing a key behind Mr. Ba's statue, the Board of Execu- tives of GDT- the successors - not only express their deep gratitude to him, but also promise that "GDT is continuing to develop based on the Virtue founda- tion". In addition, with the enlighten- ment key, GDT is totally confident to reach success in the future.
