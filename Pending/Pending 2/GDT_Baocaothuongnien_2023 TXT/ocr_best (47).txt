CHAIRWOMAN'S MESSAGE

GDTI Annual Report 2018

Dear valued Shareholders,

First of all, on behalf of the Board of Directors of Duc Thanh Wood Processing Joint Stock Company (GDT),

I would like to express my sincere gratitude and deep appreciation to shareholders, customers, partners and all staffs who are contributing, accompanying with us for many years. Hopefully, we will continue to receive your support and trust in the future.

GDT has experienced nearly three decades of operation and development, from a small workshop with an initial capital of VND 105 million and 60 work- ers founded by my Father Mr. Le Ba, up to now the company has grown with the charter capital increas- ing to over VND 171 billion and the number of employees increasing by 20 times. With more than 1.200 employees, the company not only creates stable jobs, ensures that next year's income is always higher than the previous years, but we also care about human rights, training policies, promotion opportunities, working conditions, labor safety, etc.

In order to improve material and spiritual life for all employees, to ensure that everyone could live and work in the best environment, in 2018, the Board of Executives (BOE) reviewed and replaced all facilities such as remaking ceilings, painting walls more beauti- fully, replacing plastic doors with aluminum doors at toilets; making glass; replacing old lavabo, tap water; replacing toilet paper with higher quality ones; clearing tables and chairs; improving working rooms, etc... All staffs were very welcome and excited to these reality things of the BOE. These things help the working atmosphere become more vibrant and enthusiastic. Besides, in order to attract new employees; to help employees increase their income and have more motivation to contribute to the development of overall company..., the Board of Directors (BOD) persuaded the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to approve the plan of issuing ESOP shares in 2018. This was the third time that GDT issued ESOP, two previous times were implemented in 2015 and 2016 and the effect was very visible.

It was indeed true that "What goes around comes around", this year GDT continued to finish successfully. Today when summarizing achieve- ments in 2018, I was again proud of what our collective achieved. I was very pleased to announce positive achievements in the context of many businesses declaring bankruptcy, no bonuses, no 13 month salary, and even one business forced more than 10,000 workers to quit the jobs before Tet holiday etc... However at GDT, the 2018 total revenue still grew and reached a high level. Profit after taxes from production and business activities reached the plan, up 8% over the same period. The employees not only had the 13 month

salary but also the 14 month salary, the 15" month salary, bonuses before Tet, lucky money after Tet... These achievements, once again, show that the BOD has always had strategic vision, side by side with the BOE in order to direct and to make right orientations. All staffs strictly complied with those instructions, united, created and took efforts to perform outstandingly assigned tasks, contributed to company's profits and shareholders' benefits. In 2018, the procurement of wood raw materials was still difficult, many businesses did not have wood to purchase, however, GDT still bought enough wood materials to meet production demands. This thing has affirmed the prestige and experience of GDT in the wood industry.

In parallel with doing business effectively, taking care of employees' life, GDT is always interested in creating practical values for the community through charity activities such as building bridges and improving toilets at schools in the suburbs, caring poor families at Lunar New Year, supporting disadvantaged patients in hospitals, donating food and money to help citizen bearing flood... Dear Ladies and Gentlemen!

We entered into 2019 in the context of complicated world situation with mixed advantages, difficulties and challenges. The world economy slows down; trade war, exchange rate fluctuations, risks in the financial market, climate change, natural disasters and epidemics are getting worse... One again, I believe that with a well-prepared, appropriate business strategy and concrete execution plan, the BOE will continue to have enough experience, skills and spirit to overcome difficulties.

The BOD promises to be side by side with the BOE in order to direct appropriate business methods, to ensure to bring profits to the company and continue to complete tasks assigned by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.

Finally, we would like to express our deep grati- tude to shareholders, customers, partners and friends who have supported us for many years. In particular. I would like to express my sincere thanks to all staffs who have accompanied with us on the development stages of GDT. We would like to wish you and your family good health, happiness and success!

On behalf of the BOD
